# QtFluentDesign

The goal of this project is to use Qt stylesheets to create a style for Qt widget
applications that is as close as possible to the modern [Microsoft Fluent Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/) in Windows 10. The project is in a very early state. The final goal is to provide a style
that is able to automatically adapt to the selected Windows 10 theme (light or
dark) and that is able to use the system or a user specific accent color.
